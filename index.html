            Hey there, my name is Raymond Thurman and here is a little bit of
            background about me. I was born in Louisville Kentucky. I am 30
            years old, I have been married 8 years to my gorgeous wife and we
            have two beautiful kids.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have spent close to 10 years in the US Army and led a very
            successful military career. I made the rank of Staff Sergeant,
            deployed 4 times and loved every minute of it. I had been medically
            discharged in 2015 and slowly started working toward my coding
            career.
          </p>
          <p>
            I originally had worked on training myself to code, but found that I
            lacked the structure to properly learn at a decent pace. At that
            point I had decided to use my GI Bill to go back to school. After 2
            semesters of full time work along with going to school full time and
            only having taken one class even related to computer science and
            programming, I began looking at a few other options.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was at that point when I had found Lambda School. Lambda School
            is a coding bootcamp that guarantees you a career in software
            engineering upon graduating. I was very skeptical at first but
            decided to do the pre-course work and see where it led. I was
            accepted to Lambda School and I start classes March 18th 2019.
